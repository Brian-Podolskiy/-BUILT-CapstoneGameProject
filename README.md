# -BUILT-CapstoneGameProject
"release" version of CapstoneGameProject
Doesn't require you to "build" it in Unity Editor before launch, just open the EXE file and you can play...

Requires keyboard and controller for two players. Player 1 must use keyboard to select character, and Player 2 then uses controller. 
Otherwise then selections may get mixed up
